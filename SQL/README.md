# SQL study guide
> SQL is the bread and butter for every1 in data industry. Master it in a short amount of time would be ideal.

I would recommend the following learning materials:
- [mode sql](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/) 
  - Review: gradient learning from basic to advanced with practice for each subtopic and online editor. 100% recommend
- [sql zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
  - Review: tutorial is fine. exercises are great. ~10 exercises for a subtopic like `join` will solidate the foundataion for you.
- hackerrank and leetcode
  - Review: hackerrank is relatively easy with a series of similar topic to get a good foundation. leetcode is a bit harder and i would recommend you to practice the free material first.
