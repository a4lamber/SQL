# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
First intuition is to merge all information together, then use rank to rank the total score achieved within each group

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Createa a subquery `dummy` contains player's score record with columns `group_id`,`player_id`,`score` 
    - player `left join` matches on first_player 
    - player `left join` matches on second_player
    - `union all` above two
- Create a `cte` to rank based on aggregate information in `dummy`
    - `RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC, player_id ASC) AS in_group_rank`
        - rank within each group, with the rule of `SUM(score)` in descendending order, player_id in ascending order    
- filter `cte` to select the top 1 in each group



# Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below


WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    group_id,
    player_id,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY group_id ORDER BY SUM(score) DESC, player_id ASC) AS in_group_rank
FROM
(
(SELECT
    p.*,
    m1.first_score AS score
FROM
    Players AS p
LEFT JOIN Matches AS m1 ON p.player_id = m1.first_player)
UNION ALL
(SELECT
    p.*,
    m2.second_score AS score
FROM
    Players AS p
LEFT JOIN Matches AS m2 ON p.player_id = m2.second_player)
) AS dummy
GROUP BY player_id
)
SELECT
    CTE.group_id AS GROUP_ID,
    CTE.player_id AS PLAYER_ID
FROM
    CTE
WHERE
    in_group_rank = 1;
