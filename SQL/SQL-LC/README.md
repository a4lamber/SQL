# Welcome

I store all the free SQL questions i have ever done on [leetcode](leetcode.com) here. The filename convention is based on kebab style with `doneOnMyOwn?-leetcodeQuestionNumber-questionName.sql`. For example,  for the following filename `0-1667-fix-names-in-a-table.sql`, it means, i didn't finish it on my own (look at discussion), question number 1667, and the question name is "fix names in a table". 

I also did some preliminary data exploration on the result to visualize the relative importance for each content.
