# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Intuition is to use `rank` to rank the seller's total sell price.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- create a `CTE` with an additional column `ranks` order by `SUM(Price)`
- select `where ranks = 1`

> Tips: aggregate function可以与`order by` clause连用，即使是在`over()` clasuse里; 以前`rank` 只能排序native column, 现在derived也可以了;


# Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    *,
    rank() over(order by SUM(price) DESC) AS ranks
FROM
    Sales
GROUP BY seller_id
)
SELECT seller_id FROM CTE WHERE ranks = 1;

```
