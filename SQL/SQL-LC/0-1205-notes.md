# 错误思路

我一开始的想法是先求`approved`再求`chargeback`, 俩table, 然后full outer join一下获得答案, 但遇到的问题是:
- mysql并没有`full outer join`, 需要用`union`来emulate这个操作

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

解决思路是, 先将两个表的数据统一并通过union汇总在一起，将chargeback作为一个additional state (approved, back and declined), 然后在`group by`或者这些信息


# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->

有些tricky的是需要略走一些东西.

# Complexity

# Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below


WITH cte AS
(
SELECT
    c.trans_id AS id,
    t.country,
    "back" AS state,
    t.amount,
    DATE_FORMAT(c.trans_date, "%Y-%m") AS trans_date
FROM
    Chargebacks AS c
INNER JOIN
    Transactions AS t ON c.trans_id = t.id
UNION ALL
(SELECT
    t.id,
    t.country,
    t.state,
    t.amount,
    DATE_FORMAT(t.trans_date, "%Y-%m") AS trans_date
FROM
    Transactions AS t)
)
SELECT
    trans_date AS month,
    country,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS approved_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS approved_amount, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'back' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS chargeback_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'back' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS chargeback_amount 
FROM
    cte
GROUP BY trans_date, country
HAVING 
(COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'back' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) > 0 
OR COUNT(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) > 0) 
ORDER BY trans_date ASC;

# excluding all 0 rows are tricky;
