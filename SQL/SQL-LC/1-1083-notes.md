# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Create two dummy column `get_S8` and `get_iphone` to determine whether the buyer get iphone or not. It sort of works like boolean column.
# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Since you need information from both table, you need a `inner join`. since we only care whether a buyer get S8 or iphone, we could `group by` to remove uncessary rows;
- Construct two boolean columns with `COUNT(CASE WHEN)` and utilize the fact that aggregate function `COUNT()` wouldn't count `NULL`.
- `where` row filtering with the assistance of two boolean column.


> Tips: The idea of boolean dummy column could be applied universally in other SQL problems.

# Code
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH CTE AS 
(
SELECT
    s.buyer_id,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN product_name = 'S8' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS get_S8,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN product_name = 'iPhone' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS get_iphone
FROM
    Sales AS s
INNER JOIN Product AS p
ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY buyer_id
)
SELECT buyer_id FROM CTE WHERE get_S8 != 0 AND get_iphone = 0;
