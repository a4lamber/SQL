# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
Since it is asked to report the fraction of player that logged in on the day after they first login, my first instinct is to use ranking function `rank` to rank each player by their login time.

After you have a column that shows the rank, you just need to compare whether rank 2 is one day after rank 1.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
> Tips: 对于连续两天的求解方法，可以通过join key错位转换 `a.id = b.id + 1` , 也可以直接用`lag` or `lead` .

The train of thought for this approach is:
- craete a `CTE` with extra info about the rank
- `inner join` with two condistions
  - `a.ranks + 1 = b.ranks` 保证rank 1与rank 2连接
  - `a.player_id = b.player_id` 保证只在同一个player间比较
- filtering with `where` with two conditoins
  - `DATEDIFF(a.event_date,b.event_date)` 保证这两个event只差一天
  - `a.ranks = 1`; 没有这个条件，会筛选出不包含第一天的连续两天情况， 如 假设一个player注册后登陆的日期分别是 1,2,5,6,9。那么没有这个condition,会筛选出1,2 and 5,6 但我们只需要1,2

# Code
```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

WITH CTE AS
(
SELECT
    *,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id ORDER BY event_date) AS ranks
FROM
    Activity
)
SELECT
    ROUND(COUNT(a.player_id)/(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity)*1.0,2) AS fraction
FROM
    CTE AS a
INNER JOIN CTE AS b ON (a.ranks+1 = b.ranks AND a.player_id = b.player_id)
WHERE DATEDIFF(a.event_date,b.event_date) = -1 AND a.ranks = 1;
