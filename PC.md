# Crash Course CS


## 1_Early Computing

From abacus, 

`Charles Babbage`: proposed a "difference engine" by doing polynominal. 


`Hollerith's machine`: the guy in US invent using punch card for computing. He developed this machine and start his business and merge with others unitl nowadays called `IBM`.

## 2_Electronic Computing

`Mechanical relay`: it's not fast cuz mechnical has mass. It also will wear and fail since it's a mechanical gadget. It also attracts bugs like moth. 

> `Grace Hopper`: From now on, when annything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it. (this is how we get the term bug)

`Triode vacuum tubes`: replacing over mechanical relay. It's expensive tho.

Then vacuum tubes are no longer reliable enough.

`transitor`: it has two electrodes and a gate electrode. It is now 50nm in size in modern dau computer. Since transitor is made of silicon and near california, that place is later on called silicon valley.

## 3_Boolean Logic

> from transistor to logical fate `or`, `not` and `and`. Also, exclusibe or `XOR` has been done by combing basic gates.


## 4_binary

### represent number

`base-10 notation` or `decimal notion` is what we are familar with.

比较了10进制和2进制，做了analogy.


### what about letter?
`ASCII`: a 7-bit code.

`MOJIBAKE`: scrabmbled letters. 也就是乱码

`UNICODE`: one code to rule them all. 16 bit (a million codes) to unite every lanaguage, emoji, symbols etc.


## 5_ALU

>`ALU`: Arithmetic logic unit
