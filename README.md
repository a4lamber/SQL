# How to use git

## What is git?
`git` is a tool for handling all version control. It is often confused with `github`. The main difference is that `git` is the tool that handles all of this behind the scene while `github` is the user interface on top of it.


## git Architecture

The main git architecture is shown in the diagram below.
