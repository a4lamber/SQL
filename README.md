>This is my journey for learning data science and computer science.


# Overview

Hi, my name is Adam Zhang and my background is in mechanical engineering. During my intern and official job after graduation, i found there are so many data work needs to be done from the test stations, sensors, machinery to our engineer to analyze. It usually takes forever for us to extract, transform and load into analysis-ready data and sometimes it is even impossible for large dataset since the UI for excel is such a memory hog. During my work, i fell in love with coding in python and got fascinated with the value of data and digging internal value from it. It is like a scavenger hunt. So i decide to switch my career from mechanical engineer to data science industry. This is a place for taking notes, recording my journey, coding and sharing my experience.
